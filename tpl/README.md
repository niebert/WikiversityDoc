## Handlebars4Code Templates
With a template engine like [Handlebars](https://handelebars.com) it is possible to convert a given JSON into an output format of choice in which the JSON content is filled into a specific template that contains markers. These markers define the location in the template where the JSON content should be replaced in the template. 

How template engines can be used in WebApps can be analysed in JSON editor of Jeremy Dorn that supports different template engines to render a specific output. 

A JSON Schema defines the structure of the JSON so that template engine like Handlebars will a JSON that is populated with JSON content in expected structure, so that JSON contains all relevant entries for the generated output  (e.g. [AppLSAC](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/AppLSAC).

[`handlebars4code`](https://gitlab.com/niehausbert/handlebars4code) is just a standard Handlebars libraries with additional libraries for code generation (see [ClassEditorUML](https://niebert.github.io/ClassEditorUML/))
